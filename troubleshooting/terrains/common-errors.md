## Recovering a File

### Repair File

Use the `File > Repair` menu item to have Gaea attempt to re-containerize the terrain file and remove any extraneous information or bad data remnants that may prevent a file from being opened or used properly.

## Baking

### Baked Data does not load

Usually, this happens when one or more baked cache files are corrupted or were not baked properly. Deleting the cache and re-baking the nodes should fix the issue.
