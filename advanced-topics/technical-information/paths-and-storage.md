# Paths and Storage

## Data

Gaea stores all application data, excluding Projects, in a centralized directory known as the Data folder.

### **Standard Installation**

If Gaea is installed in the Program Files directory, the Data folder is located at:

`<UserFolder>\AppData\Roaming\QuadSpinner\Gaea\2.0`

### **Portable Installation**

The default location for a Portable Installation is:

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Gaea 2.0`

If Gaea is installed in a portable location, the Data folder is located adjacent to the Gaea.exe file.

For example, if your install location is: `D:\Programs\CG\Gaea\` then the Data folder will be stored at `D:\Programs\CG\Gaea\Data\`&#x20;
