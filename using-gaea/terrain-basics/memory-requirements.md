# Memory Requirements

Knowing how much memory Gaea will need for your project helps avoid performance issues and crashes. Here’s a simplified approach to understanding memory requirements in Gaea.

**Understanding Memory Needs**

* **Memory Demand**: The more complex and detailed your terrain, the more memory it requires.
* **Factors Affecting Memory**: Resolution, node complexity, and layering all influence memory usage.

### **Resolution**

* **Impact of Resolution**: Higher resolutions consume more memory. A 2048x2048 resolution needs significantly less memory than an 8192x8192 resolution.
* **General Rule**: Doubling the resolution quadruples memory usage. For example, going from 1024x1024 to 2048x2048 will increase memory requirements fourfold.

### **Heightfields**

* **Heightfield**: The 3D representation of your terrain in Gaea.
* **Memory Calculation**:
  * Memory required = Resolution (width x height) x Bit Depth
  * Gaea uses 32-bit heightfields for high precision.
* **Example**: For a 1024x1024 resolution with 32-bit depth:
  * 1024 x 1024 x 4 bytes = \~4 MB

### **Layering Nodes**

* **Nodes**: Each node in Gaea represents an action or modification. More nodes mean more memory.
* **Layering**: Stacking multiple layers adds depth but also increases memory requirements.

### **System Memory and Performance**

* **Plan for Headroom**: Keep at least 25-30% of your system’s RAM free to ensure smooth performance.
* **Memory-Saving Tips**: Use lower resolutions and simpler nodes while experimenting. Gradually increase complexity as your project nears completion.

### **Exporting**

* **Export Size**: The larger the resolution at export, the more memory you’ll need during that process.
* **Preview Exports**: Try lower resolutions for test exports to verify results before the final high-resolution export.

## **Quick Tips for Beginners**

* **Start with Lower Resolutions**: Build your terrain in 1024x1024 and increase resolution as needed.
* **Simplify Your Node Graph**: Fewer nodes use less memory. Start with basic nodes and add detail as you go.
* **Keep Track of Available Memory**: Regularly check your system’s memory usage to prevent overloads.

With these tips, you’ll be better prepared to manage memory efficiently in Gaea and ensure smoother workflows and stable project builds.
