# Unity Node

The Unity node lets you export your heightfield as a `^2+1` heightmap.

You can add up to 10 inputs.&#x20;

The node's Target Size property lets you select the resample size. It is recommended that you select your Gaea build resolution to be the closest to the size you need. Based on your current Build Resolution set in the [build-options](../build-options/ "mention"), you will be given a recommended Target Size.

You can set the file format for all the exported files.
