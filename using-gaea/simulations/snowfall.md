# Snowfall

The Gaea Snow node is a powerful snowfall precipitation simulator. It uses advanced physics to simulate particles of snow with realistic clumping, adhesion, melt, thaw, and settling.

The simulation realistically simulates sequences of snowfall, melting, and settling that occur in real life.&#x20;

The Snow simulation's highlights are an intuitively controllable snowfall vs melt mechanism. Rather than simply reducing the amount of snowfall, you can mimic real life by keeping a higher level (or rather a longer duration, to be exact) of snowfall but also intersperse each snowfall cycle with a melt cycle. This creates more believable blankets of snow.

## Dusting

Gaea 2.0 introduces a new lightweight snow node called Dusting which adds a thin layer of snow to your scene with a focus on creating light sprinklings of snow.

This node can be used with or without Snow.
