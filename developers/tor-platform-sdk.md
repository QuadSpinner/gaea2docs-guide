# TOR Platform SDK

Gaea is built on QuadSpinner's proprietary TOR Platform, a powerful terrain processing engine.

The TOR Platform leverages cutting-edge technologies such as advanced vector computations, hybrid CPU/GPU processing, SIMD/SPMD processing, and a full framework dedicated to creating and managing complex terrain graphs.

The TOR Platform is built on Microsoft .NET 8.0 and is programmed using C#.
