# Scripting and Expressions

Gaea is built around a very powerful, flexible, and extensible core. With Gaea 2.1.1 we are introducing a range of new advanced power-user features that can help you transform a Gaea project into a parametric powerhouse.

These offerings are the first portion of what will be the [tor-platform-sdk.md](../tor-platform-sdk.md "mention").

[variables.md](variables.md "mention")**.** Define a variable such as Float, Integer, Choice, Bool, Color, or String. These variables can be bound to different node properties. Variables can be controlled through the UI or the [Command Line](../../advanced-topics/automation/command-line-automation.md).

[expressions.md](expressions.md "mention")**.** Expressions are modifiers applied to either a property, such as a slider, or to the variable bound to the property. It allows you to make modifications to the incoming value.

[math-node.md](math-node.md "mention")**.** The Math node is powerful computational node that let you write your own shapes using scripting. It can consume Variables you declare in the Gaea UI so you can actually control your script through external controls.

[**Exposed Properties**](../../getting-started/user-interface/property-editor/binding-variables.md)**.** This not a direct feature but a byproduct of [variables.md](variables.md "mention"). You can expose a specific property from a node, and have it be available just like other Variables and edit your node from the Variable Editor panel.
