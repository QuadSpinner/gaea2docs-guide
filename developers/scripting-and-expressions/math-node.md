# Math Node

The Math node is a deceptively powerful node with a very simple interface. It is essentially a blank canvas for you to create any kind of mathematical functions or even complex algorithms.

The Math node can work standalone as a Generator, but can also accept up to 3 inputs. These inputs can be accessed as `a`,`b`,`c` respectively. Note, those are pre-defined variables and can't be used for any other purposes except to access data from the port.

You can also access coordinates per-pixel using `x` and `y` .

### Syntax and Functions

The Math node can accept the following.

```basic
// Mathematical operators
+, -, *, /, %, ^

// Equalities & Inequalities 
=, ==, <>, !=, <, <=, >, >=

// Assignment 
:=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

// Logical operators 
and, nand, nor, not, or, xor, xnor, mand, mor

// Functions
abs, avg, ceil, clamp, erf, erfc, exp, expm1, floor, frac,
hypot, iclamp, inrange, log, log10, log1p, log2, logn, max,
min, mod, mul, ncdf, pow, root, round, roundn, sgn, sqrt,
