# Macros

**Macros** let you create your own custom nodes by combining existing Gaea nodes into a reusable package. They are ideal for encapsulating complex workflows or techniques into a single, manageable node. This saves time, avoids duplication, and makes it easy to share your methods with others.

**Macros** look and behave like any other node in Gaea, but under the hood, they contain a predefined graph. You can expose specific parameters from that internal graph as properties on the macro, allowing for a clean, streamlined interface while retaining full control over the underlying logic.

Macros are scheduled for Gaea 2.3
