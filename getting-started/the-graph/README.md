# The Graph

## The Infinity Graph <a href="#the-infinity-graph" id="the-infinity-graph"></a>

Gaea's advanced graph-based workflow is the key to creating sophisticated terrains. This open-ended workflow gives you the flexibility to create almost any kind of results that you want.

### **What are nodes?**

If you have not used node-based workflows before, they may look intimidating, but they aren't. Gaea provides an artist-friendly workflow where you are not required to create complex graphs to get good results.

Each node is a heightfield processor that performs a single task. By connecting several nodes, you can create an elaborate program or "recipe" for creating a complex process. Some nodes provide more than one output and input. These additional "ports" can be used for more sophisticated processing of your terrain.

Node graphs go from left to right, never the opposite. They represent a one-way flow.

To learn more about node graphs, see [procedural-workflow.md](procedural-workflow.md "mention").

Also see [lock-preview-and-underlays.md](lock-preview-and-underlays.md "mention").

### Conveniences

Gaea supplies several quality-of-life features which make it easier to work with complex graphs. For instance, you can quickly create structures as merges (Combining two nodes), interject a node within an existing network, re-organize a complex graph area with Chokepoints, and more.

See [graph-conveniences.md](graph-conveniences.md "mention")

## Separating and Organizing the Graph

### Tabs

The Infinity Graph allows you to split your terrain graph across multiple Tabs using [portals-and-chokepoints.md](portals-and-chokepoints.md "mention"). This allows you to separate concerns - such as creating the main shape, producing colors, exporting masks, and so on. By reducing the clutter, complex processes become easier to visualize and modify.

You can move select nodes to different tabs. Portals will be created as required to ensure your connections stay intact.

For more information see [organizing-with-tabs.md](organizing-with-tabs.md "mention")

### Groups

You can group a set of nodes in a collapsible container called a Group. Groups can be assigned colors and icons, and can also be collapsed to hide the nodes within them. They are a great way to organize your graphs.
