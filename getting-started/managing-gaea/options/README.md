* Color Maps: Sets the default file format for color maps to export.
* Masks: Sets the default file format for Masks to export.
* **Remove Primary port name in Build output**: Hides the primary port name in the output of the build process.

***

## Cache

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Gaea Options Cache (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Delete after 45 days**: Automatically deletes logs and autosave files after 45 days to manage disk space and maintain performance.
* **Always Cache to Disk on Close**: Ensures that data is saved to disk upon closing Gaea, when project loads next time, it loads the saved cache.
* **Use Smart Cache**: Allows Gaea to dynamically manage caching based on current system usage and available resources.
* **Idle Threshold (0 minutes)**: Sets the time threshold for inactivity after which smart caching mechanisms kick in.

***

## Viewport

### Device List

**Available Devices:** Lists all available computer devices that Gaea can use for processing terrains.

* Sub-options under each device allow you to select which technology is enabled for that device. For example, OpenCL, Level Zero, CUDA, etc.

**Scan Hardware and Determine Speeds**: Initiates a scan of all hardware to evaluate processing capabilities and optimize device selection. Once done, a score for each device and technology is shown in the list.&#x20;

See [benchmark-devices.md](../../../troubleshooting/diagnostics-watson/benchmark-devices.md "mention") for additional information.

### Driver Issues

If Gaea detects driver issues with any devices, an error readout will be shown next to that device. Depending on the issue, the device may be prevented from loading in Gaea until the driver has been updated.

### CPU-only mode

Gaea can be forced to run using CPU only. This may not necessarily bring performance down too much as Gaea uses advanced techniques to keep performance up while using the CPU.

If you are experiencing instabilities, disabling GPU and Accelerators may improve stability.

See [cpu-only-mode.md](../../../troubleshooting/diagnostics-watson/cpu-only-mode.md "mention")

## Experimental

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Gaea Options Experimental.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **Preview Options**

* **Enhanced RAM Optimization**: Toggles experimental RAM optimization to improve memory management. Requires a restart to take effect; disabling is recommended if instability occurs.
* Disable UI animations: Selecting this option will disable UI animations.
* Custom Locations to show in File Dialogs: Paths entered in this textbox will appear on the left pane of file dialogs. Custom paths can be entered on per line.
* Show only these locations: Toggling this option will only show these paths in the file dialog.

***

Each setting in the Options dialog allows fine-tuning of Gaeaâ€™s behavior and performance to best suit your project requirements and hardware setup.
