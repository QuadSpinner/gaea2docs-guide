# Presets

Gaea enables users to save the current settings of a node as a preset. This preset can then be applied to other instances of the same node type.&#x20;

### Creating a preset

To create a preset, select the desired node within the graph.&#x20;

You can create the preset by selecting "Create Preset" from the "Presets" menu in the Node main menu. Alternatively, presets can also be created directly from the preset menu located in the property editor's toolbar submenu.&#x20;

It will open a create preset dialog.

Enter a meaningful name for the preset.&#x20;

Checking the option "Make these the default settings for this type of node" will save the current node settings as default settings for current node type. When a new node of this type is created, it will have these settings applied.

Clicking on "Create Preset" button will create the preset. We have named the preset "Long Duration". This new preset will now be visible in preset menu. clicking on this preset will apply its settings to the selected node.
