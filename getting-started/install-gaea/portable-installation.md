### Choosing the Path

Next, select where you would like to install Gaea.&#x20;

By default, it will install to `C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Programs\Gaea 2.0`

You can save to a more accessible or memorable path if you prefer. You can install it on a USB drive.

Gaea will now install. You will be given an option to launch Gaea once the installation is finished.



## Welcome to Gaea

### License Key

If you have a License Key, you can also enter it here to activate all the features of your Gaea Edition. You can find the License Key in the email you received after purchasing Gaea 2.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have forgotten your License Key, you can click "Forgot your key?" to log into the User Area on the QuadSpinner website.
{% endhint %}

You can also enter your License Key from the Start Screen whenever you start Gaea, or from Help > About menu item. See Licensing for more details.

### File Licenses

For users who have been issued a file-based key, just drag and drop the file (usually a `XYZ123.lic` file) on the license dialog. Gaea will automatically consume the file to authorize your copy.
