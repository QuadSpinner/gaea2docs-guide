# Version Numbers

Gaea uses 4 parts in its version number - such as 2.0.5.1 - where these parts are called Major (2), Minor (0), Build (5), and Revision (1).

**Major:** This is the main version number representing the generation of the software. This part updates once every couple of years, denoting a major upgrade.

**Minor:** This part is updated whenever a significant update is made to the software. For example, when a paradigm-shifting or large new feature is added.

**Build:** This part is updated when any substantial change is made. This is often new functionality or overhauling existing tools.

**Revision:** This part is updated when small updates or bugfixes are implemented but the overall impact on the user is limited.
